## Prerequisites for SAS Viya ARK
Obtain the latest version of SAS Viya ARK with every new software order.

Each item that is included in the resource kit provides a document that describes its specific prerequisites and functionality.

For example, a functioning [Ansible Controller](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html) is required to run  the Ansible playbooks that are included below in the [Pre-installation Playbook](playbooks/pre-install-playbook) section. A list of the available playbooks is provided.

Related Tools Not Contained in SAS Viya ARK:

## Known Support Issues
The following issues are known and may impact the expected usage or performance of the Viya ARK tools.

* SAS Viya 3.5 supports Linux on Power on a limited availability basis. The SAS Viya ARK tools do not support Linux on Power in the Viya35-ark-1.0 release.
* Viya ARK Pre-Install Playbook SSL check play may fail to complete if multiple sets of SSL configuration files exist.  The playbook will not fail, but subsequent tasks related to SSL Certificate check will be skipped.  Workaround the issue by ensuring only one configuration file specifying ``SSLCertificateFile`` exist under ``/etc/[httpd|apache2]`` root directory.
