# SAS Viya Administration Resource Kit (SAS Viya ARK) - SAS Viya Multi-Machine Services Utilities (MMSU) Playbooks 

## Introduction

The SAS Viya Multi-Machine Services Utilities repository contains a set of playbooks to start or stop the SAS Viya services gracefully across the 1 - n machines that are identified in the inventory.ini file.

## Requirements for Running the MMSU Playbooks

* All services must have an Up status after the deployment has completed.
  See "Running the Playbooks" for instructions on listing the status of SAS Viya services.
* The MMSU playbooks must be placed under the sas_viya_playbook directory where SAS Viya was deployed.
  The directory structure of this project must be preserved.
  For example: ```sas_viya_playbook/viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/```
* Verify that the sas-viya-all-services script is exempted from system reboots. See viya-services-disable.yml playbook.
* sas-viya-all-services script should not be run manually on any machines when using MMSU playbooks.

## Supported deployment of MMSU Playbooks

* Single-machine deployment
* Multi-machines deployment
* Multi-tenant deployment
* Clustered database deployment

## Unsupported Viya Deployment

* Programming-only deployment

## Running the Playbooks

To list the status of all SAS Viya services and URLs, execute:
```
ansible-playbook viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/viya-services-status.yml
```
To exempt sas-viya-all-services from system reboot, execute:
```
ansible-playbook viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/viya-services-disable.yml
```
To stop all services gracefully, execute:
```
ansible-playbook viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/viya-services-stop.yml
```
To start all services gracefully, execute:
```
ansible-playbook viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/viya-services-start.yml
```
To restart all services gracefully, execute:
```
ansible-playbook viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/viya-services-restart.yml
```
To start the minimally required set of services prior to starting a Restore, execute:
```
ansible-playbook viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/viya-services-restore.yml
```
To disable sas-viya-all-services to run on system reboot, execute:
```
ansible-playbook viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/viya-services-disable.yml
```
To enable sas-viya-all-services to run on system reboot, execute:
```
ansible-playbook viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/viya-services-enable.yml
```

## Notes about the viya-services-start-restore.yml Playbook
The `viya-services-start-restore.yml` playbook is used to simplify some of the operations
required by the Restore process

Before running the `viya-services-start-restore.yml` playbook, all services must be stopped using
the `viya-services-stop.yml` playbook. The `viya-services-start-restore.yml` playbook will start the
minimal set of services required for a restore operation.

The minimal set of services that will be started are enumerated in the `viya-services-start-restore-vars.yml`
file.

See the [Restore](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/calcdc/3.5/calbr/n1607whucnyc02n1eo6tbvl1tzcs.htm)
documentation for more information. 

## Notes about the systemctl status Command

The SAS Viya MMSU tool uses SAS Viya Postgres HA (high availability) to start the SAS Infrastructure Data Server services. It does not use systemctl. Hence, the command systemctl status may not report correctly for the following services:

```
sas-viya-sasdatasvrc-postgres-nodeX
sas-viya-sasdatasvrc-postgres-nodeX-consul-template-operation_node
sas-viya-sasdatasvrc-postgres-nodeX-consul-template-pg_hba
sas-viya-sasdatasvrc-postgres-pgpoolX
sas-viya-sasdatasvrc-postgres-pgpoolX-consul-template-operation_node
sas-viya-sasdatasvrc-postgres-pgpoolX-consul-template-pool_hba
```

IMPORTANT The systemctl command does not provide a status of a service that it did not start.

## Tips

* When running playbook viya-services-stop.yml and seeing sas stray processes:
```
    "msg": [
        "Please examine the following stray process(es)",
        "If enable_stray_cleanup=true, it will be cleaned up automatically",
	"except database processes which require fix manually to avoid data corruption."
        "This playbook can be rerun to clean up the child processes",
        [
          ...
        ]
    ]
```
  If the processes listed are ok to be cleaned up, the user may issue command as below:
```
    ansible-playbook viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/viya-services-stop.yml -e "enable_stray_cleanup=true"
```
  The user can also modify viya-services-vars.yml file as follows, then rerun the playbook.
```
    enable_stray_cleanup: true
```
* When running playbook viya-services-stop.yml, there is a pause message for the stop confirmation:
```
    TASK [WARNING: All Viya services are about to be stopped!]
    Pausing for 10 seconds
    (ctrl+C then 'C' = continue early, ctrl+C then 'A' = abort)
    [WARNING: All Viya services are about to be stopped!]
    Press 'ctl+c' to interrupt the process. If no response, playbook will continue after 10 seconds:
```
  The user may modify viya-services-vars.yml file as following to disable the pause timer or pass the variable through the command line.
```
    enable_pause_timer: false
```
* An experimental, alternative method of starting and stopping services based on server resource utilization is optionally available using the enable_svs_alternative variable.
```
    ansible-playbook viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/viya-services-start.yml -e "enable_svs_alternative=true"
    ansible-playbook viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/viya-services-stop.yml  -e "enable_svs_alternative=true"
```
  Note: if an order contains Common Planning Service (CPS), you will not be able to use the alternative method.
